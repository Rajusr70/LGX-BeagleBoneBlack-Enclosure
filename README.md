LGX BeagleBone Black Enclosure
==============================

SolidWorks Model of the LGX BB100 BeagleBone Black Enclosure

3D PDFs (open in Adobe Reader) of each part and assembly

Newly added/updated: 


7/11/13

- IGS, STEP, and SLDPRT/SLDASM files of each part and assembly. All parts updated to latest revision!

- STL files for 3D printing and such. 
3D Printing Notes: 1) You will still need screws for the case.  2) Currently the standoffs embedded in the bottom half of the chassis are seperate parts, which may present a problem for affixing the Beaglebone. An update will make these files more accessible to 3D printing soon.
