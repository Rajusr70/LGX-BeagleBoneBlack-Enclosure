3D PDFs (open in Adobe Reader) of each part and assembly

Solid Models in various formats

Newly added/updated: 

06/16/14

- Added in hardware and PEMs where they were missing. Thanks to user ZARk-be for calling my attention to their absence.

01/10/14

- Changed file formatting to take advantage of Github's built in STL viewing capabilities. There is still a separate folder for files that are 3D printer-friendly.

7/16/13

- Added an STL file for the bottom chassis more friendly to 3D printing.  There are no longer separate PEMS in this version, they are now incorporated into the bottom of the case itself, and have unthreaded holes appropriate for the screws used (which you'll still need to assemble the case). An STL of the top of the chassis is also contained in "LGX-BeagleboneBlackEnclosure_3DPRINT" to make your life easier. Enjoy, and be sure to share if you're adventurous enough to print it!


7/11/13

- IGS, STEP, and SLDPRT/SLDASM files of each part and assembly. All parts updated to latest revision.

- STL files for 3D printing and such. 
3D Printing Notes: 1) You will still need screws for the case.  2) Currently the standoffs embedded in the bottom half of the chassis are seperate parts, which may present a problem for affixing the Beaglebone. An update will make these files more accessible to 3D printing soon.

- All files contained in zip, simply download and extract to get at them. Enjoy!
